Subject: more on close window...
Status: R


Roger,

Here's the code to go through all the application's windows.
Note that the below methods are for 0.8; thus the code for going through 
windows will change under 0.9. (0.9 does not use the ObjC OrdCollection class.
The only change is that the "size" method is renamed "count" in the
0.9 List class; not a major change.)

Ali

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    register unsigned offset;
    id windowList = [NXApp windowList];
    int numWindows;
    id theWindow;

    numWindows = [windowList size];
    for (offset = 0; offset < numWindows; offset++) {
	theWindow = [windowList at:offset];
	// do anything you want to the window except get rid of it (see below)
    }

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's another interesting tidbit; the way Application's terminate: method
closes windows. You might find that if you want to close windows, you need
to go backwards... If your method only saves and does not close, you can get 
away with the code above.

 /*
  * Must go through in reverse order since close may remove the window
  * from the ordered collection. 
  */
    if (offset = [windowList size])
	for (offset--; offset >= 0; offset--)
	    [[windowList at:offset] close];
